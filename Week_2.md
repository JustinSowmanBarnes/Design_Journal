# Remote Employee’s 

I would like to start off with the evolution of working online instead of the office and how it has evolved rapidly in these past few years. Because of Covid there are more and more employees becoming remote which means that there is an ever-increasing need for screen sharing apps, cloud storage and video calling software, this is all produced and maintained by IT businesses. The amount of remote employee’s has been ever increasing with statistic’s saying that by 2025 36.2 million Americans will be working remotely that will be an 87% increase compared to pre covid, with all these employees moving to working online the need for IT businesses will almost always be stable. 

# Website and App Development 

 In class we learnt that because of Covid 19 the IT business has now become a booming industry with company's looking to modernize their websites making them more easily accessible and appealing to the customers, this is because since Covid has kept people at home, customers are now more on the internet than ever. The statistics say that in 2019 online holiday sales were only 138.62 billion dollars compared to in 2020 where holiday sales made a whopping 201.32 billion dollars, that’s a major 45.2% increase in sales, with these kinds of sales being made it’s no wonder that companies are looking to update their websites and mobile app’s.  

# Communication’s 

With the recent influx of employee’s now working online there has been need of easy and accessible communications for employers and employees, this has opened a gap for the IT business which are able to produce and maintain these applications for example Zoom was a mediocre application before Covid 19 with 40 million people partaking in the app but it didn’t rise to its full potential until Covid hit which increased its user base by 67% in the first three months of the year 2020 this kind of rise is what makes the it business so appealing. 

# Conclusion 

In my opinion Covid 19 has actually been beneficial to the IT business, with the increasing need for online software and applications the IT business has really started to boom. I find it exciting that new software is being developed every day and that these applications can help me evolve my IT skills in the future.
